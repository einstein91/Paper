Monoenergetic protons were produced with the 3.5 MV AIFIRA (Applications Interdisciplinaires de Faisceaux d'Ions en R{\'{e}}gion Aquitaine) accelerator at the Cen-tre d'Etudes Nucl{\'{e}}aires de Bordeaux Gradignan (CENBG). The IPs were irradiated with protons backscattered off a tantalum target. We present the photo-stimulated luminescence response of the IPs together with the fading measurements for these IPs. A method is applied to allow correc-tion of fading effects for variable proton irradiation duration. Using the IP fading corrections, a model of the IP response function to protons was developed. The model enables extrapolation of the IP response to protons up to proton energies of 10 MeV. Our work is finally compared to pre-vious works conducted on Fuji TR IP response to protons.},

Here, we demonstrate the generation of soft-X-ray undulator radiation with laser-plasma-accelerated electron beams. The well-collimated beams deliver soft-X-ray pulses with an expected pulse duration of ∼10 fs (inferred from plasma-accelerator physics). Our source draws on a 30-cm-long undulator 11},

abstract = {Laser-driven accelerators, in which particles are accelerated by the electric field of a plasma wave (the wakefield) driven by an intense laser, have demonstrated accelerating electric fields of hundreds of GV m(-1) (refs 1-3). These fields are thousands of times greater than those achievable in conventional radio-frequency accelerators, spurring interest in laser accelerators as compact next-generation sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread, which limits potential applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance and increased energy (more than 10(9) electrons above 80 MeV). Our technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer propagation distance. The results open the way for compact and tunable high-brightness sources of electrons and radiation.},

abstract = {Ultrashort flashes of THz light with low photon energies of a few meV, but strong electric or magnetic field transients have recently been employed to prepare various fascinating nonequilibrium states in matter. Here we present a new class of sources based on superradiant enhancement of radiation from relativistic electron bunches in a compact electron accelerator that we believe will revolutionize experiments in this field. Our prototype source generates high-field THz pulses at unprecedented quasi-continuous-wave repetition rates up to the MHz regime. We demonstrate parameters that exceed state-of-the-art laser-based sources by more than 2 orders of magnitude. The peak fields and the repetition rates are highly scalable and once fully operational this type of sources will routinely provide 1 MV/cm electric fields and 0.3 T magnetic fields at repetition rates of few 100 kHz. We benchmark the unique properties by performing a resonant coherent THz control experiment with few 10 fs resolution. The advent of laser-based coherent THz emission and THz detection schemes more than 25 years ago 1,2 has revolutionized linear spectroscopy and imaging 3 in the THz frequency range and helped to improve our funda-mental understanding of matter tremendously. THz pulses have since been utilized as gentle sensitive probes of fundamental low-frequency excitations in solids, liquids or gases 4–7 . Key of the success of this technology is the possibility to generate and detect these THz pulses coherently, thereby providing an excellent dynamic range and circumventing detection of the large intrinsic thermal background in the THz regime. More recently, the generation of THz pulses with much higher field amplitudes has become possible, which permitted a conceptually new approach for investigating low energy degrees of freedom in matter 8,9},

Therefore, beam diagnostics different from those known from classical particle accelerators such as synchrotrons or linacs are required. Easy to use single-shot techniques are favored, which must be insensitive towards the EMP and associated stray light of all frequencies, taking into account the comparably low repetition rates and which, at the same time, allow for usage in very space-limited environments. Various measurement techniques are discussed here, and a space-saving method to determine several important properties of laser-generated electron bunches simultaneously is presented. The method is based on experimental results of electron-sensitive imaging plate stacks and combines these with Monte Carlo-type ray-tracing calculations, yielding a comprehensive picture of the properties of particle beams. The total charge, the energy spectrum, and the divergence can be derived simultaneously for a single bunch.},

So far, the large spectral width of laser-plasma-driven beams has been preventing a successful free-electron laser (FEL) demonstration using such sources. In this paper, we study the application of an optimized undulator design and bunch decompression to large-energy-spread beams in order to permit FEL amplification.

abstract = {High-power lasers that fit into a university-scale laboratory can now reach focused intensities of more than 10(19) W cm(-2) at high repetition rates. Such lasers are capable of producing beams of energetic electrons, protons and gamma-rays. Relativistic electrons are generated through the breaking of large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created in the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through a plasma, or through a direct interaction between the laser field and the electrons in the plasma. However, the electron beams produced from previous laser-plasma experiments have a large energy spread, limiting their use for potential applications. Here we report high-resolution energy measurements of the electron beams produced from intense laser-plasma interactions, showing that--under particular plasma conditions--it is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low divergence and a small energy spread (less than three per cent). The monoenergetic features were observed in the electron energy spectrum for plasma densities just above a threshold required for breaking of the plasma wave. These features were observed consistently in the electron spectrum, although the energy of the beam was observed to vary from shot to shot. If the issue of energy reproducibility can be addressed, it should be possible to generate ultrashort monoenergetic electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the future development of 'table-top' particle accelerators.},

Introduction Plasma based concepts providing compact high gradient acceleration of electron and ion bunches receive growing interest in the particle accelerator community. Highest peak currents at ultra-short pulse duration, high initial energies, and point-like sources represent beam parameters that may open numerous applications from medical therapy to compact and bright light sources. On the other hand, a number of parameters like energy spread, average power, reproducibility, or matched diagnostics remains to be understood and controlled before demanding applications can be served in routine operation, standard to conventional rf accelerator technology.

abstract = {One of the major goals of research for laser-plasma accelera-tors 1 is the realization of compact sources of femtosecond X-rays 2–4 . In particular, using the modest electron energies obtained with existing laser systems, Compton scattering a photon beam off a relativistic electron bunch has been proposed as a source of high-energy and high-brightness photons. However, laser-plasma based approaches to Compton scattering have not, to date, produced X-rays above 1 keV. Here, we present a simple and compact scheme for a Compton source based on the combination of a laser-plasma accelerator and a plasma mirror. This approach is used to produce a broadband spectrum of X-rays extending up to hundreds of keV and with a 10,000-fold increase in brightness over Compton X-ray sources based on conventional accelerators 5,6 . We anticipate that this technique will lead to compact, high-repetition-rate sources of ultrafast (femtosecond), tunable (X-through gamma-ray) and low-divergence (∼18 8 8 8 8) photons from source sizes on the order of a micrometre. A Compton scattering source operates by colliding a relativistic electron bunch and an intense laser pulse. The electrons travelling in the electromagnetic field oscillate and emit synchrotron-like radiation, commonly referred to as Compton scattering radiation. The scheme provides a double Doppler upshift of incident photon energy by relativistic electrons 7 . For an entirely optical realization of this scheme, two intense laser pulses are required 8–10 , the first to create a plasma accelerator and the second to scatter off the accelerated relativistic electrons. While attractive in its potential, this scheme has never yet produced radiation above a few keV 10 . Here, we demonstrate high-energy femtosecond X-ray radiation from Compton backscattering (hundreds of keV range) in a purely optical scheme that is both simple and robust. As shown in Fig. 1a, an intense femtosecond laser pulse focused into a millimetre-scale gas jet drives a wake-field cavity in which electrons are trapped and accelerated. This is the laser-plasma accelerator. A foil is positioned close to the exit of the gas jet and at nearly normal incidence with respect to the laser and electron beam axis . The foil is ionized by the rising edge of the laser pulse, resulting in a plasma mirror 11 that efficiently reflects the laser pulse (the reflectivity is expected to be larger than 70{\%} for a 0 ≥ 0.04; ref. 12). This approach provides an inherent overlap in time and space of the back-reflected laser and the relativistic electrons for Compton backscattering. The experimental set-up is presented in Fig. 1b. The relativistic laser pulse is focused into a 3 mm gas jet to produce an electron beam (see Methods). For the sake of simplicity and reproducibility, the laser-plasma accelerator was set to produce electrons in the forced laser wake-field regime 13 , with a broadband spectrum extend-ing up to an energy of E ≈ 100 MeV (corresponding to a Lorentz factor of g ¼ E[MeV]/0.511). The measured charge in an electron bunch was 120 pC. The foil used was either 1 mm of glass or 300 mm of CH. Supplementary Fig. S1 presents electron spectra obtained with (i) the foil in the gas jet, (ii) the foil with a hole in it corresponding to the laser propagation axis and (iii) the foil outside the gas jet (more than 1 cm after the gas jet). It shows that the presence of the foil or interaction with the foil do not significantly improve or degrade the properties of the electron beam. In this relativistic interaction, radiative processes other than Compton backscattering can produce X-ray radiation. Careful measurements were performed to identify, evaluate and minimize their contribution to the overall emission. In our parameter regime, betatron radiation is emitted in the few keV range and},

The measurable energy range extends from 1 to 100 MeV or even higher. The IP response in this energy range is calibrated using electrons from L-band and S-band LINAC accelerator at energies 11.5, 30, and 100 MeV. The calibration has been extended to 0.2 MeV using an existing data and Monte Carlo simulation Electron Gamma Shower code. The calibration results cover the energy from 0.2 to 100 MeV and show almost a constant sensitivity for electrons over 1 MeV energy. The temperature fading of the IP shows a 40{\%} reduction after 80 min of the data taken at 22.5 ° C. Since the fading is not significant after this time we set the waiting time to be 80 min. The oblique incidence effect has been studied to show that there is a 1 / cos ␪ relation when the incidence angle is ␪.},

abstract = {Laser-plasma accelerators of only a centimetre's length have produced nearly monoenergetic electron bunches with energy as high as 1 GeV. Scaling these compact accelerators to multi-gigaelectronvolt energy would open the prospect of building X-ray free-electron lasers and linear colliders hundreds of times smaller than conventional facilities, but the 1 GeV barrier has so far proven insurmountable. Here, by applying new petawatt laser technology, we produce electron bunches with a spectrum prominently peaked at 2 GeV with only a few per cent energy spread and unprecedented sub-milliradian divergence. Petawatt pulses inject ambient plasma electrons into the laser-driven accelerator at much lower density than was previously possible, thereby overcoming the principal physical barriers to multi-gigaelectronvolt acceleration: dephasing between laser-driven wake and accelerating electrons and laser pulse erosion. Simulations indicate that with improvements in the laser-pulse focus quality, acceleration to nearly 10 GeV should be possible with the available pulse energy.},
